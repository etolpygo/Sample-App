== README

This is a sample application created by following Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial (with very minor modifications), with motivation & guidance courtesy of Douglas Putnam's Rails course at City College of San Francisco.

This project uses:

* Ruby version 2.0

* Rails 4.0

* Bootstrap 2.3

* Some Google fonts

I can't imagine why anybody would want to fork this, but you're welcome to do so.
